# 👋 Hello, I'm Sam Phelan!

I'm a design-focused full stack developer (and former data engineer) with a passion for creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. With experience in both front-end and back-end development as well as ETL and distributed systems, I strive to bridge the gap between design and functionality to deliver seamless user experiences.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎨 **Design Enthusiast**: I believe that a great user interface is essential for an engaging user experience. I love collaborating with designers to bring ideas to life while ensuring the final product is both beautiful and functional.
- 💻 **Full Stack Development**: I have expertise in various technologies, allowing me to build comprehensive applications from the ground up. My skills include:
  - **Front-end**: React, Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/Typescript
  - **Back-end**: Node.js, Express, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, MongoDB, SQL
  - **DevOps**: Git, Docker, CI/CD pipelines

## 🔧 Skills

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js, Express
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD
- **Testing**: Jest, Vitest, Cypress
- **Others**: Responsive design, Accessibility (a11y), Performance optimization

## 🌟 Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase some of my skills:

- **[Pulsewidth UI](https://github.com/samphelan/pulsewidth-ui)**: This is an open-source React UI component library that I built to support [Pulsewidth Lab's](https://pulsewidthlabs.com) proprietary applications. It features many advanced UI components such as text inputs with autocomplete, and it is versatile enough to be used as the backbone of any React application.
- **[GeoCoordinate Utilities](https://github.com/samphelan/calculate-relative-coordinates)**: Some utility functions for dealing with lat-long coordinates. These functions were developed to support [Pulsewidth Lab's](https://pulsewidthlabs.com) propriety location-based search applications but can be used by any application that needs to deal with lat-long coordinates/spherical trigonometry.

Most projects that I've worked on professionally were made on company version control accounts and cannot be made public, so this is not a comprehensive representation of my skillset but hopefully gives an idea of my attention to detail and knowledge of the development process.
